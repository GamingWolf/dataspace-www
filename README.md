To make this work:

1. install Hugo and Node: on a Mac with Homebrew, `brew install hugo` and `brew install node`
2. install Node modules: `npm install`

Once that is done, type `hugo` and it should build everything automagically. Enjoy!

Note: Node on Windows may have a problem resolving dependencies. We're not sure why.
