To make this work:

1. install Hugo and Node: on a Mac with Homebrew, `brew install hugo` and `brew install node`
2. install Node modules: `npm install` and most likely `npm install postcss` and `npm install autoprefixer`

Once that is done, type `hugo` and it should build everything automagically. Enjoy!
